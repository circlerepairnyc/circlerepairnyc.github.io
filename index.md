# Circle Repair NYC
*We are asking healing justice and anti-racist organizing communities, the NYC hair community, and individuals commited to supporting QTPOC and survivors of state sanctioned violence for support in a mutual aid request for accountability from Ann, for harm enacted in her relationship with Vijaya (she/they). Described below are the harms enacted, and further you can find what the survivor’s asks are to feel safe in their neighborhood of Crown Heights, where they’ve lived for the past decade.*

## Content Warning <a name="content-warning"></a>
Content warning for what's below: includes descriptions of racialized harm and intimate partner violence, and threats of state/police intervention. We distinguish between hurt, harm and abuse along the spectrum of privileges /oppressions within the dynamics of white supremacist capitalist cisheteropatriarchy. Please read if/when you are feeling up for it, when you have a glass of water handy, or any other tools you use to ground. We recommend [this sheet from the NYC TJ Hub on self-guided self care (hyperlinked)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/123TviiR-DcRdH_dpfYVpOVrdy_plVgPzztCJ8ALOh40/edit).

## What Happened & Why It Matters <a name="what-happened"></a>
Ann enacted a dynamic of harm towards Vijaya in their two year relationship through various forms of control: continued physical harassment/ intimidation, fetishization, isolation, taking over shared resources and threatening state/police intervention. Specifically, on June 19, 2019, while in a relationship and living with Vijaya, Ann threatened to call the police on them within the space of their shared apartment.  Ann made these threats knowing Vijaya's history with state and federal violence, including their experiences and trauma with police and U.S. surveillance, particularly the post 9-11 rise in racial profiling, islamaphobia and xenophia.

Vijaya shared this history exhibiting vulnerability and trust in this intimate partnership, but Ann knowingly used this history against them. That day in an attempt to protect themselves from further harm, Vijaya asked Ann for space to be left alone, which while challenging in a small apartment can be respected. Instead, Vijaya was met with both verbal and physical abuse, which left them a trauma-based freeze mode. The night of June 19, 2019 was Vijaya's last at this apartment where they were the leaseholder. In the process of trying to safely move out of this space, Ann threatened Vijaya of withholding their rightful security depository and their own belongings. For more details on this night, please see [Vijaya's instagram highlight from August 2019](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18060947569087735/).

Since ending their relationship, Vijaya has sought to bring about a process to redress this harm (see full timeline below in “What we’ve tried and what hasn’t worked”).  Ann has called Vijaya’s requests for accountability a “smear campaign”. She also wielded harmful systematically stigmatized language such as "psychotic" or “manipulative” to describe their behavior when asking for accountability. Aware of Vijaya’s history of being misdiagnosed as well as forcibly institutionalized in a psych ward, Ann knowingly used this particular language to evade accountability and to attempt to discredit Vijaya. 

This matters because Vijaya shared their painful personal history with Ann and she used that pain against them. Some of that history includes Vijaya’s racial and gender-based profiling as dark-skinned Telegu South Asian trans person. 

This profiling began in 2002 while living in Texas and then later that year in British Columbia on a work visa. Over a six year period, Vijaya was targeted repeatedly by the police, the FBA, as well as multiple Homeland Security departments (TSA, counterterrorism units, and Customs and Border Patrol).

Vijaya has experienced over a dozen incidents, stops, detentions, and formal interrogations (where they were held for four or more hours using psychological and physical intimidation i.e ["SERE" techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival,_Evasion,_Resistance_and_Escape#American_Use_of_%22SERE_Techniques%22_in_%22Detainee%22_Interrogation/Torture)). After being pulled off a train mid-route in Austin, Texas by FBI agents in 2008, Vijaya moved to Crown Heights, Brooklyn, seeking a new environment for their mental health and safety.

In the threat to call the police on Vijaya, Ann enacted racial privilege and aligned herself with this state power, mimicking forms of control through inciting fear, immobility and confinement in Vijaya. Ann betrayed the intimacy and trust of holding vulnerable information about Vijaya (both their trauma with the police and forced institutionalization) by weaponizing these forms of power against them in a personal conflict, and gaslighting them about this after the fact.

Vijaya’s history of trauma is central to why the threat to call the police on them was harm, in addition to the fact that Ann enacted racial and gendered privilege in that threat. That dynamic of power and privilege remains in place until today, which is why we find this mutual aid request pressing still. Since the incidents described above, Ann has opened a hair studio blocks away from Vijaya’s home in Crown Heights—where they have lived for a decade—on their route to public transportation, and any run-ins or even potential run-ins have a detrimental impact to Vijaya’s physical and mental wellbeing. While Ann may be able to write off this incident and rebrand as a white ally to her growing number of social media followers, Vijaya holds the memory in their body as do we, those who support them.

This matters too because since opening up about their harm, Vijaya has had many others come forward sharing that they too had experienced similar threats within intimate partner relationships of mixed privilege. We’ve heard about this happening too many times. We believe this issue is not just about Vijaya, but about anyone that has been in this position where power resulting from white supremacy has been wielded against them in an intimate setting. 

## What we’ve tried and what hasn’t worked <a name="what-tried"></a>
Vijaya has tried many times to bring about an accountability process while also transiting their own process of healing. Initially this work was done without outside support, which, as many survivors know and have experienced, is completely exhausting. One of Vijaya’s attempts for accountability was with a member of the Yellow Jacket’s Collective. This member volunteered themselves as a mediator between Vijaya and Ann. However, this YJC member was dishonest with Vijaya and failed to disclose the fact that they had a personal and financial relationship with Ann and her hair studio at the time. Additionally, this member of YJC conducted one of their mediation sessions at a bar, fed Vijaya alcohol and ambushed Vijaya by placing them in direct contact with their abuser. In summation, YJC acted to protect the person who caused harm and continued harm on Vijaya. Some of us began working with Vijaya and hearing their story through a Transformative Justice Book Club, and Circle Repair began meeting one year ago (July 2020) with the aim of inviting Ann to a confidential accountability process, which she rejected.

In this public statement describing the harm that took place, we are calling attention to the ways in which people with differing privilege can enact deep levels of harm and retraumatization with or without realizing it. People with racial / cisgender / class / neurotypical privilege may not understand the impact of their actions because they lack those lived experiences, and they are still responsible for the harm their behavior causes. This statement is intended to sensitize those with privilege to the ripple effects of their harmful actions when they choose to engage intimately with people of color, trans people, mad or disabled people and working class people without consideration for their life experience.

This callout is an attempt to break silence over a persisting power dynamic. It comes after a series of attempts to bring a confidential accountability process directly to the person who caused harm. Harm is still happening and boundaries are still being violated. So we are resorting to this callout after exhausting all options available to us.

*What has been tried before we began this process:*

-   In August of 2019 Vijaya posted publicly about the harm caused. See the original post [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B01OC_OgZnM/) and the story highlight [here](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18060947569087735/). Ann calls this a "smear campaign", states that she was harmed and that Vijaya is "psychotic"---this narrative spreads among the wider queer NYC community.

-   Vijaya attempted to find a mediator for an accountability process and was offered help by Yellow Jackets Collective, but this process unraveled.

-   Some of us began meeting as a Transformative Justice Bookclub, reading the [Creative Interventions Toolkit](https://www.creative-interventions.org) with the hope of building the tools to carry out community accountability processes on our own.

-   Vijaya workshopped their process in multiple supportive transformative justice spaces, including NYC TJ Hub.

-   After no mediator was found and with the news that Ann was opening her studio blocks away from Vijaya's home and en-route to their closest subway stop, we began to meet as Circle Repair NYC.

*What we've done as a group:*
We have tried to move cautiously and carefully forward by 

-   getting clear about the harm

-   grounding in our values of transformative justice, establishing group agreements and community guidelines (see "About Us" section)

-   mapping out potential allies and barriers

-   building a curriculum for the accountability process, and

-   reaching out to those who might be able to be a support team for Ann (with no success).

When no other option seemed available, we reached out to Ann directly via email inviting her into the process and informing her of Vijaya’s asks, which was met with flat refusal by Ann and where we all witnessed the types of harmful language she uses to characterize and discredit Vijaya. We are now calling on our greater communities to recognize the needs of the survivor (see “What are the asks” below) and help us bring about conditions for Ann to take accountability.

Given that we have exhausted the avenues available to us, we now present this call-out publicly. We ask people to receive it with the same grace and rigor we have attempted to embody throughout this process, and in the care of writing this. We ask for people who read this, regardless of your involvement with the people mentioned, to imagine the type of support a survivor of this harm would need, how much work has gone into them processing their pain, and how using their voice is and has been the path of most resistance. We see this callout as a labor of love towards the communities we touch. This is an attempt to create dialogue where it has been absent.

## What are the asks <a name="asks"></a>
The asks of the survivor are directly tied to redressing the current and ongoing harm enacted by Ann. We do not see these as punishments, but as needs of the survivor to maintain security in their day to day life and neighborhood, and consequences for the person who has caused harm. The survivor has expressed that they have no desire of being in further contact with the person who caused them harm. The accountability process would be carried out by a support team chosen by Ann and the members of this group not directly involved in the relationship. 

The following are the survivor's asks (in order of immediacy and importance):

1.  For Ann to move the location of her studio on Nostrand Ave, and eventually relocate neighborhoods (out of Crown Heights).

2.  For Ann to negotiate boundaries around groups and events that may take place in the overlap of their circles (ie. which events not to go to, what happens when both people are there).

3.  For Ann to write a public apology for the harm caused.

4.  For Ann to participate in a TJ process that addresses topics such as: racialized harm and unlearning racial privilege, white performative allyship on social media, DARVO (gaslighting strategy of denying, attacking and reversing victim and offender), and taking accountability for harm.

## How you can support <a name="support"></a>
We acknowledge that each person’s role, depending on their networks, relationships, and proximity to power will be different in this mutual aid request. 

Below we’ve outlined some possible actions and what you can do if you find yourself in these positions.

1.  If you do not know Ann: We ask that you please do not reach out to her, comment on her social media, or contact her in any way. We want to emphasize that our goal here is not one rooted in cancelling this person, but instead bringing about accountability and getting the survivor's needs met. Online comments and messages from strangers can feel alienating, isolating and cause one's defenses to shoot up and we think this is counterproductive to our goals. We encourage people to talk about this issue with those you know and trust (word of mouth is best). As we've stated, we know this isn't the first time this kind of harm has taken place within an intimate relationship setting, and that others may have similar experiences. We are here at <circlerepairnyc@gmail.com> if you have questions, comments or a need to communicate.

2.  If you are close to Ann (not one of her hair clients): Feel free to reach out to us (<circlerepairnyc@gmail.com>) if you would like to discuss forming part of Ann's support team, with her consent. 

3.  If you are a client of Ann: Make a choice whether to continue supporting her business while it remains in Crown Heights and while she has not taken accountability for this harm.

## How we can support you <a name="support-you"></a>
We are available at <circlerepairnyc@gmail.com> to engage in dialogue, share resources, language, and information about this instance of harm or about what the transformative justice process has looked like for us in general. We have readings we can share that we've learned from directly. We also can offer our internal materials on how we've structured our own process of forming a support team for Vijaya, including our community guidelines and group agreements. If this is something you feel you need in your own circle / pod, please feel free to reach out. We are committed to communication guided by the values of generosity, sincerity and transparency. We ask for your patience in us getting back to you as for each of us this is a commitment outside of our full-time work.
