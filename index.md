# Mutual Aid Request for Jaya
_This is a Mutual Aid Request intended to secure safety and stability for Jaya, a dark-skinned Telegu South Asian trans survivor of intimate partner violence by her white ex-partner, Ann._

_We are making this request after trying to engage in a confidential accountability process with Ann, who has refused any and all requests for accountability. She has since opened a business close to where Jaya  has lived for over a decade, which impacts Jaya’s sense of safety and wellbeing._

## What Happened <a name="what-happened"></a>
Ann caused harm in her partnership with Jaya by:
-   Threatening state/police intervention (specifically threatened to call the cops on Jaya on June 19, 2019) knowing Jaya's history of violence by cops
-   Continued physical harassment/intimidation
-   Taking over shared resources
-   Fetishizing
-   Isolating Jaya when she spoke out about the harm

After their relationship ended:
-   Refusing to take accountability for harm
-   Moving her business and her home into Crown Heights, where Jaya has lived for over a decade. Her business is now 1 block away from Jaya's apartment, on her way to the train. This has a huge impact on Jaya's mental health.
-   Ann's business on Nostrand Ave, where her prices are inaccessible ($110 for a haircut, $36 for 3.5 oz of shea butter and $60 for hand sanitizer), contributes to a process of gentrification of Crown Heights to push out and price out Black and POC people and businesses. More info on this [here](https://thebridgebk.com/nostrand-avenue-why-its-new-gentrification-flash-point/) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klqHzXQVWKs).

Now:
-   Ann has refused to participate in any form of accountability process, which has brought us to the point of having to make this public request online
-   Ann maintains her business in Jaya's neighborhood which makes it hard for her to leave her house or feel safe in her home

## Needs <a name="needs"></a>
These are the survivor’s needs (in order of immediacy / importance):
1.  For Ann to move her studio on Nostrand Ave to another neighborhood, and for her to eventually relocate her home out Crown Heights
2.  For Ann to negotiate boundaries around groups and events that may take place in the overlap of their two circles (ie. which events not to go to, what happens when both people are there)

**Please know that these needs are the bare minimum of what the survivor has asked for over time, due to this process being stalled and Ann's refusal to be accountable. They are not punishments for harm caused but consequences for what happened.**

## What You Can Do <a name="what-to-do"></a>
### If you do not know Ann:
We ask that you please **do not** reach out to her, comment on her social media, or contact her in any way. We encourage people to talk about this with those you know and trust.
1.  Our goal here is not rooted in canceling this person. Online comments and messages from strangers can feel alienating, isolating and make one's defenses shoot up. We think this is counterproductive to our goals.
2. Also, we know this isn't the first time this kind of harm has taken place within an intimate relationship setting, and that others may have similar experiences. We are here at <circlerepairnyc@gmail.com> if you have questions, comments or a need to communicate. We'll do our best to get back to you in a timely manner.

### If you are close to Ann:
Reach out to us (<circlerepairnyc@gmail.com>) if you would like to discuss coordinating support for Ann fulfilling this mutual aid request or forming part of Ann's support team, with her consent. If you don't want to be in contact with us, try to have conversations with Ann about the importance of this mutual aid request / call for accountability.

### If you are a client of Ann:
Make a choice whether to continue supporting her business while it remains in Crown Heights and while she has not taken accountability for this harm.

## Details <a name="details"></a>
_Below is a longer-form description of what happened for anyone who wants more information or details. CW: racial harm, weaponizing whiteness / white femininity, intimate partner violence, threats of calling police on a partner in an intimate setting. Please continue reading if/when you are feeling up for it, or with grounding tools at hand. We recommend [this sheet from the NYC TJ Hub on self-guided self care](https://docs.google.com/document/d/123TviiR-DcRdH_dpfYVpOVrdy_plVgPzztCJ8ALOh40/edit)._

Jaya (she/her) is a survivor of multiple forms of racial and gender-based profiling and state violence as a dark-skinned Telegu South Asian trans person. In her relationship with Ann (the person who caused harm and who is white), Jaya experienced various forms of control based on her being a person of color including: continued physical harassment/intimidation, fetishization, isolation, seizing shared resources and threatening state/police intervention.

Specifically, on June 19, 2019, while in a relationship and living with Jaya, Ann threatened to call the police on her within the space of their shared apartment. Ann made these threats knowing Jaya's seven-year history with state and federal violence, including her experiences and trauma with police and U.S. surveillance, particularly the post 9-11 rise in racial profiling, islamaphobia and xenophia.

Ann knowingly used Jaya's trauma history against her. That day, in an attempt to protect herself from further harm, Jaya asked Ann for space to be left alone, which, while challenging in a small apartment, can still be respected. Instead, Ann met Jaya with both verbal and physical abuse, which left her in a trauma-based freeze mode. The night of June 19, 2019 was Jaya's last at this apartment where she was also the leaseholder. In the process of trying to safely move out of this space, Ann threatened to withhold Jaya's security deposit and her own belongings. For more details on this night, please see [Jaya's Interview](https://circlerepairnyc.github.io/interview.html).

Since ending their relationship, Jaya has sought to bring about a process to redress this harm.  Ann has called Jaya's requests for accountability a "smear campaign". She also used harmful language such as "psychotic" or "manipulative" to describe Jaya's behavior when she asked for accountability. Aware of Jaya's history of being misdiagnosed and forcibly institutionalized in a psych ward, Ann knowingly used this particular language to avoid taking accountability and to discredit Jaya.

Jaya's history of trauma is central to why the threat to call the police on her was harm, in addition to the fact that Ann enacted racial and gendered privilege (based on white femininity aka. Karen-ing) in that threat. That dynamic of power and privilege remains in place today, which is why we find this mutual aid request so urgent. Since the incidents described above, Ann has opened a hair studio blocks away from Jaya's home in Crown Heights---where she has lived for a decade---directly on route to her Subway stop at Nostrand Ave. Ann's business also forms part of a gentrification process of Crown Heights, called the "Bed-Stuy Renaissance" by developers.

Any run-ins or even potential run-ins with Ann have a detrimental impact on Jaya's physical and mental wellbeing. While Ann may be able to write off this incident and rebrand as a social justice-oriented white ally to her growing number of social media followers, Jaya holds the memory in her mind and body as do we, those who support her.

This matters too because since opening up about her harm, Jaya has had many others come forward sharing that they too had experienced similar threats within intimate partner relationships of mixed privilege. We've heard about this happening too many times. We believe this issue is not just about Jaya, but about anyone that has been in this position where power resulting from white supremacy has been wielded against them in an intimate setting.
