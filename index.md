# Circle Repair NYC
*We are asking for the Brooklyn healing justice, anti-racist organizing communities for support in a mutual aid request for accountability from Ann Causey, for harm enacted in her relationship with Vijay Yeeda (she/they). Described below are the harms enacted, and further you can find what the survivor’s asks are to feel safe in their neighborhood of Crown Heights, where they’ve lived for the past decade.*

## Content Warning <a name="content-warning"></a>
Content warning for what's below: includes descriptions of racialized harm and intimate partner violence, and threats of state/police intervention. Please read if/when you are feeling up for it, when you have a glass of water handy, or any other tools you use to ground. We recommend [this sheet from the NYC TJ Hub on self-guided self care (hyperlinked)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/123TviiR-DcRdH_dpfYVpOVrdy_plVgPzztCJ8ALOh40/edit).

## What Happened & Why It Matters <a name="what-happened"></a>
Ann has caused harm to Vijay physically, financially (withholding security deposit), as well as made threats of state/police intervention. On June 19, 2019, while in a relationship with Vijay, Ann threatened to call the police on them. This action put Vijay in a trauma-based freeze mode, and Ann made this threat knowing Vijay’s traumatic history with the police and the U.S. surveillance state.

Since ending their relationship, Vijay has sought to bring about a process to redress this harm (see full timeline below in “What we’ve tried and what hasn’t worked”).  Ann has called Vijay’s requests for accountability a “smear campaign”. She also wielded harmful systematically stigmatized language such as "psychotic" or “manipulative” to describe their behavior when asking for accountability. Aware of Vijay’s history of being misdiagnosed as well as forcibly institutionalized in a psych ward, Ann knowingly used this particular language to evade accountability and to attempt to discredit Vijay.

This matters because Vijay has experienced racial and gender-based profiling, particularly since 2003. They have been targeted repeatedly by the police, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security. They have experienced over a dozen incidents, stops, and confined interrogations (typically being held for four or more hours with little to no contact or information offered to them).

In the threat to call the police on Vijay, Ann enacted racial privilege and aligned herself with this state power, mimicking the same types of control through inciting fear, immobility and confinement in Vijay. Ann betrayed the intimacy and trust of holding vulnerable information about Vijay (both their trauma with the police and forced institutionalization) by weaponizing these forms of power against them in a personal conflict, and gaslighting them about this after the fact.

Vijay’s history of trauma is central to why the threat to call the police on them was harm, in addition to the fact that Ann enacted racial and gendered privilege in that threat. That dynamic of power and privilege remains in place until today, which is why we find this mutual aid request pressing still. Since the end of their relationship, Ann has opened a hair studio blocks away from Vijay’s home in Crown Heights—where they have lived for a decade—and any run-ins or even potential run-ins have a detrimental impact to Vijay’s physical and mental wellbeing. While Ann may be able to write off this incident and rebrand as a white ally to her growing number of social media followers, Vijay holds the memory in their body as do we, those who support them.

This matters too because since opening up about their harm, Vijay has had many others come forward sharing that they too had experienced similar threats within intimate partner relationships of mixed privilege. We’ve heard about this happening too many times. We believe this issue is not just about Vijay, but about anyone that has been in this position where power resulting from white supremacy has been wielded against them in an intimate setting. 


## What we’ve tried and what hasn’t worked <a name="what-tried"></a>
Vijay has tried many times to bring about an accountability process while also transiting their own process of healing. Initially this work was done without outside support, which, as many survivors know and have experienced, is completely exhausting. There have also been attempts to engage communities in NYC with this process that have stalled or put Vijay in a more vulnerable situation. Some of us began working with Vijay and hearing their story through a Transformative Justice Book Club, and Circle Repair began meeting one year ago (July 2020) with the aim of inviting Ann to a confidential accountability process, which she rejected.

Call-outs like these are scary for all involved—for the survivor, for the community and for the person who caused harm. **By the very nature of living on this earth we have all experienced, witnessed and/or caused harm, at varying degrees of severity depending on our proximity to privilege and power.** However, when we call attention to harm, pain and injustice, this is often met with punishment, silencing and further harm. We would much prefer to meet the survivor’s needs without exposing them to the public backlash that a callout can bring. However, there are times when a person who has caused harm is unwilling to acknowledge their harm and continue to perpetuate it, where a call out (not a cancellation) is necessary. We believe this is one of those instances.

We agree with the writing of [mirroredlove18](https://mirroredlove.com/we-have-a-culture-of-silence-not-call-out-culture/) when they say, "It is my belief that callouts are a tool to disrupt imbalance power dynamics." Even one of the most outspoken and visible critics of so-called "callout culture," adrienne maree brown still says:  "There is absolutely a need for certain call outs--when power is greatly imbalanced and efforts have been made to stop ongoing harm, when someone accused of harm won't participate in community accountability processes or honor requested boundaries, the call out is a way of pulling an emergency break. But call outs need to be used specifically for harm and abuse, and within movement spaces they should be deployed as a last option" (We Will Not Cancel Us 52). In this case, we believe we have exhausted all options available to us, and the harm is still happening.

*What has been tried before we began this process:*

-   In August of 2019 Vijay posted publicly about the harm caused. See the original post [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B01OC_OgZnM/) and the story highlight [here](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18060947569087735/). Ann calls this a "smear campaign", states that she was harmed and that Vijay is "psychotic"---this narrative spreads among the wider queer NYC community.

-   Vijay attempted to find a mediator for an accountability process and was offered help by Yellow Jackets Collective, but this process unraveled [do we want to go into more detail here as to why? Or do we want to keep YJC as a potential ally here?]

-   Some of us began meeting as a Transformative Justice Bookclub, reading the [Creative Interventions Toolkit](https://www.creative-interventions.org) with the hope of building the tools to carry out community accountability processes on our own.

-   Vijay workshopped their process in multiple supportive transformative justice spaces, including NYC TJ Hub.

-   After no mediator was found and with the news that Ann was opening her studio blocks away from Vijay's home, we began to meet as Circle Repair NYC.

*What we've done as a group:*
We have tried to move cautiously and carefully forward by 

-   getting clear about the harm

-   grounding in our values of transformative justice, establishing group agreements and community guidelines (see "[About Us](./about-us)" section)

-   mapping out potential allies and barriers

-   building a curriculum for the accountability process, and

-   reaching out to those who might be able to be a support team for Ann (with no success).

When no other option seemed available, we reached out to Ann directly via email inviting her into the process and informing her of Vijay's asks, which was met with flat refusal by Ann and where we all witnessed the types of harmful language she uses to characterize and discredit Vijay. We are now calling on our greater communities to recognize the needs of the survivor (see "What are the asks" below) and help us bring about conditions for Ann to take accountability.

Given that we have exhausted the avenues available to us, we now present this call-out publicly. We ask people to receive it with the same grace and rigor we have attempted to embody throughout this process, and in the care of writing this. In the words of [mirroredlove18](https://mirroredlove.com/we-have-a-culture-of-silence-not-call-out-culture/): "Rather than continuing to discuss whether or not call outs are "good" or "bad", I wonder what it would look like if a community of care actually rallied around the person doing the call out? **I wonder what would happen if we took the same energy we used to discredit call outs to support survivors and create communities of care for survivors and for those who have caused harm?**  I wonder what it would look like if we reframed the connotations behind the call out, and saw it as an act of love, a tool to bring awareness to unfairness, and a moment that could open up a larger dialogue about what community care could look like for all of us?"

## What are the asks <a name="asks"></a>
The asks of the survivor are directly tied to redressing the current and ongoing harm enacted by Ann. We do not see these as punishments, but as needs of the survivor to maintain security in their day to day life and neighborhood, and consequences for the person who has caused harm. The survivor has expressed that they have no desire of being in further contact with the person who caused them harm. The accountability process would be carried out by a support team chosen by Ann and the members of this group not directly involved in the relationship.

The following are the survivor's asks (in order of immediacy and importance):

1.  For Ann to move the location of her studio on Nostrand Ave, and eventually relocate neighborhoods (out of Crown Heights).

2.  For Ann to negotiate boundaries around groups and events that may take place in the overlap of their circles (ie. which events not to go to, what happens when both people are there).

3.  For Ann to write a public apology for the harm caused.

For Ann to participate in a TJ process that addresses topics such as: racialized harm and unlearning racial privilege, white performative allyship on social media, DARVO (gaslighting strategy of **d**enying, **a**ttacking and **r**eversing **v**ictim and **o**ffender), and taking accountability for harm.

## How you can support <a name="support"></a>
We acknowledge that each person's role, depending on their networks, relationships, and proximity to power will be different in this mutual aid request.

Below we've outlined some possible actions and what you can do if you find yourself in these positions.

1.  If you do not know Ann: We ask that you please do not reach out to her, comment on her social media, or contact her in any way. We want to emphasize that our goal here is not one rooted in cancelling this person, but instead bringing about accountability and getting the survivor's needs met. Online comments and messages from strangers can feel alienating, isolating and cause one's defenses to shoot up and we think this is counterproductive to our goals. We encourage people to talk about this issue with those you know and trust (word of mouth is best). As we've stated, we know this isn't the first time this kind of harm has taken place within an intimate relationship setting, and that others may have similar experiences. We are here at <circlerepairnyc@gmail.com> if you have questions, comments or a need to communicate.

2.  If you are close to Ann (not one of her hair clients): Feel free to reach out to us (<circlerepairnyc@gmail.com>) if you would like to discuss forming part of Ann's support team, with her consent. 

3.  If you are a client of Ann: Make a choice whether to continue supporting her business while it remains in Crown Heights and while she has not taken accountability for this harm.

## How we can support you <a name="support-you"></a>
We are available at <circlerepairnyc@gmail.com> to engage in dialogue, share resources, language, and information about this instance of harm or about what the transformative justice process has looked like for us in general. We have readings we can share that we've learned from directly. We also can offer our internal materials on how we've structured our own process of forming a support team for Vijay, including our community guidelines and group agreements. If this is something you feel you need in your own circle / pod, please feel free to reach out. We are committed to communication guided by the values of generosity, sincerity and transparency.
