# Who we are: Circle Repair NYC
We are a group of people gathered by values of transformative justice, remembering and redressing harm. We are supporters of Vijay, acting in relation with them along the family/friend spectrum. Some of us met through an autonomous Transformative Justice Study Group where we read through the Creative Interventions Toolkit. For some of us, this was the first instance of hearing about the harm Vijay experienced, and from this place we decided to practice what we had read about in the Toolkit to attempt to initiate an accountability process and to get Vijay’s needs met as a survivor. Others have been in relationship with Vijay much before this, and have witnessed their traumatic encounters with state violence. All of our members are or at one point were connected to New York City and the queer, recovery, healing justice, anti-racist and/or organizing communities. Many of us are survivors of violence and intimate harm. We are a coalition--we are not an identity-based group and come from many backgrounds and experiences--with this we hold space for and reckon with our differences, in particular our varying vulnerabilities to violence. We are here to learn together and learn about community accountability away from carceral, police, surveillance logics.

We approach this process in the spirit of learning, curiosity, and awareness that we cannot be experts on transformative justice until we practice it with each other at every level of relating, and that even then “the very systems we are working to dismantle live inside us” (Morgan Bassichis, Communities United Against Violence), so we are also in a constant process of unlearning. We follow the writing and words of those who have been doing this work for decades—Mariame Kaba, Mia Mingus, Shira Hassan, Kai Cheng Thom, and others—most of whom are women and NB people of color heavily impacted by the Prison Industrial Complex. We’ve been informed by community accountability groups—Support New York, NYC TJ Hub, to name a few—that have historically worked in community to address harm. We have lingering questions about how to do this work: How do we bring an unwilling person who caused harm into a process without being punitive, cancel-y or shaming? How do we create a culture where there are incentives for taking accountability, rather than shying away from harm or gaslighting? How do we meet the needs of survivors if the person who caused harm to them refuses to participate or acknowledge these needs? How do we work in community when our current reality is characterized by dispersal (because of COVID or other forms of isolation/displacement)?

We define our work as being survivor-centered, meaning everything done in this process happens with the knowledge or consent of the survivor. We support the survivor’s healing process above all else, which we recognize is not always about outcomes of the process, but about being held, heard and witnessed. We understand accountability as Ann Russo does, as “a practice, not an end … a continuous process rather than a single act” and “It requires a willingness not only to name oppression but to understand our relationship to its perpetuation” (Feminist Accountaibility 11). In taking care of the impact we have on each other and tending to that interconnection, accountability emerges.
