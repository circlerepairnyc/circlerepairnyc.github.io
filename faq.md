# FAQ
In response to questions that have come up in the past regarding this situation, we have put this FAQ together as an interview with the survivor, Jaya, whose voice is expressed here. While these are responses to those questions, we are not trying to convince anyone. This is just a space for the survivor to share her story.

**The specific documents/evidence mentioned below are marked in capital letters, and are available to pod members or close relations committed to TJ by request via email at <circlerepairnyc@gmail.com>.**

## Didn't this happen a long time ago? Why is this an issue?

I'm still addressing it because it is an ongoing issue. Defamation, slander, ableism are all ongoing. Ann's business was opened blocks from my home after the assault. This business is still in my neighborhood, along my subway path. This continued defamation, slander, and racism is a clear example of DARVO. 

[ANN'S RESPONSE TO OUR INVITATION LETTER.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19B60BA9lbg1TWm0_thoHphgFnf4hkSiDbczNxap-4Eo/edit?usp=sharing)

## Isn't this just a she-said-she-said situation with two different accounts where it is hard to know what the truth is?

Yes, no one can know what happened between two individuals when they were not present, so of course neither perspective can be taken at face value. My question would then be why have you taken your perspective as the one that is correct? What does that intrinsic trust have to do with race, gendered identity, class? It is indeterminable. That means that there is no reason for you to cling strongly to believing Ann's story is correct. You should at least create a level of curiosity because then maybe you can more fully hear what both experiences are and be able to come to your own position. We hope you can keep a mind of curiosity and openness about this.

## If this is an unknowable situation, and no one else saw or witnessed what you are claiming, is there any evidence to your claims?

We acknowledge that the concept of evidence has many questions. That being said, the things we offer you will hopefully create some understanding of what took place.

Here's what we can show that provides evidence.

One of the things that is named is control of shared property. For this we can show the RENTAL AGREEMENT, CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN VIJAYA AND LANDLORD, EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN ANN AND JAYA. Showing Ann's attempt to withhold a security deposit and to attempt to forcibly remove me from our shared apartment before our agreed date. The frustrating thing about harm is that even if you were to film what took place and show it to people, some will most likely respond the way they do now. The question of evidence is moreso a culture that does not believe survivors and there will never be enough evidence to face that attitude. There are even critiques of incidents caught on camera.

What I can provide is TEXT EXCHANGES AND RECEIPTS indicating the day of the harm, showing conversations with Ann the night of the incident where I am begging for safety. After the night of the abuse and the threat the next day, I can show you evidence of having to leave my apartment that day following the incident which was prior to our agreed upon date by weeks and the incurred expenses for my abrupt move. You can see the receipts. I don't believe you need evidence here, but if you care about evidence, here's some evidence. If this matters to you, and helps you support the survivor, then here's some evidence.

The ongoing harm is calling Jaya a liar and abuser or crazy which is dog whistling racism and transphobia through accusing her of abuse. Evidence from email exchanges and screenshots from third parties. When Jaya posted the call out/call in, people came to her to show screenshots of Ann along with the staff of Vacancy Project calling Jaya crazy, abusive, and a liar after posting. People contacted me with SCREENSHOTS of these exchanges.

Location. I've been here for 12 years. Ann moved into the neighborhood because I have connection with this place. Part of the ongoing harm is that Ann has replicated claiming ownership of our shared apartment by claiming ownership of this area through her businesses' gentrifying presence. The location is a very sensitive spot in the last few dominoes of an ongoing Crown Heights and Bedstuy gentrification project. Her business acts as a wedge, a point of access in bringing hip white wealthy and white-adjacent to a location which has long been held as problematic due the high houseless population and issues of those communities. These undesirables are being harassed and any white-owned business has a lot to reflect on with their claims of rights in this area.

Summary: In the callout, everything mentioned here can be verified. I still stand behind every thing claimed with that initial post. Pattern of fetishization. Any honest inquiry with long term relations of Ann are places to consider.

For example, Ann's close friend of 10 years, Ashley, owns a clothing boutique here in NYC called TheDrive which is financed by her family's accumulated wealth through slave and plantation ownership. Ashley's mother currently owns a former slave plantation in 2021, with the hopes of using it as a tourist wedding destination. Over Christmas her mother complained to me how expensive operations for a plantation were. 

Or better than all of that, you can have an honest conversation with any of Ann's ex-partners of color. Other aspects mentioned here are patterns and you can witness this through texts so forth. Some things have no concrete evidence but there is evidence. It is very apparent in the lived experience of myself, the survivor.

Here's what we can show that provides evidence. This is my real experience. These are some things that will hopefully give you support.

Why would I leave my apartment with all these things going on if not for something happening?

## Ann mentioned that you are mentally ill?

First off, that statement is ableist. Secondly, this is a pattern where people come out with accusations and we have a sick kind of pity because they are labeled emotional or erratic. This to me is a sneaky way of avoiding. No one's mental health needs to be exposed, but I can share that I have had multiple years of relationships with my therapist, pod community, and family. At no point have I been diagnosed as having delusions or hallucinations or any of the kind. There's no basis for this.The only formal diagnosis I have received is PTSD from my multi-year experience with state authorities. I find it really nasty someone is indirectly calling me a liar by calling me mentally ill. I know what happened to me. It's gaslighting and it's sneaky.

There is EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE pressing for us to meet with third-party therapists which Ann refused. Ann resisted any third-party look at the situation. Now where I am at, it is easy to make stories about who I am and that has had an effect on my life. I have anxieties about other people viewing me through that lens and limiting my ability to go out and enjoy my life. In the end when people say they are being cancelled, more often than not it is the person making the accusation that is usually effectively canceled and the person accused has power and stays in power in society and that way never ends up answering. We, by default, accept the narrative of the abuser. So, the environment is such that it ostracizes people who have experienced harm because of this attitude of ambivalence and distrust that doesn't support survivors.

## Why is this a big deal?

Many people may not understand the nature of this harm because many people do not understand the harm. The history of racism and patriarchy in this country are not often understood in their totality, specifically in their psychic effects and PTSD. This is the nature of what it is meant to be in trauma, but I wouldn't be making this request if it wasn't a real need and of value to my well being.

The primary harm was about state surveillance and homeland security. That is my multi-year lived experience that I cannot change about myself. The closest thing a person can do is understand other forms of PTSD and consider people that have been held in facilities, incarcerated, etc. Even after they've been released they have long-lasting effects.

## My friend said you were actually the one causing harm.

We reject this accusation. These kinds of statements only start happening after the original harm took place. DARVO. These are defense tactics to avoid accountability and change narratives. You can see correspondence months before between and after to see that those claims don't sit right. If there were questions about hurt because people do hurt each other. I am not claiming that I have no regrets, but there was nothing which crossed into harm and definitely not abuse. All harm experienced could be clarified with an accountability process, which Ann rejected.

There is no evidence for any of these claims. The statement is not true and it is a tactic to change the subject.

## I know Ann and I've never seen anything like that

Most intimate partner violence happens behind closed doors and many people outside do not know about these things. Even if people treat you nicely as an acquaintance or client. People do not usually spot those close to them causing harm. The very fact that we know so much violence takes place in intimate partnerships but don't seem to find actors within our circle raises questions.

In conclusion, no one can know what happened. The point is to listen to survivors. That's it. Not to agree. Just to listen.

Many of the people I reached out to based on shared identity like BUFU, YJC, and others that claimed to be supporting victims of racism, police brutality, transphobia and intimate partner violence. They claim to be an ally in these issues. Then, when their friend is accused of these issues, it somehow is not possible. My question is, if it is not happening around you then where in the mythical world is it happening? Maybe this is an opportunity to check themselves to see how much yt innocence and yt womens innocence and networks of cis terf class privileged influenced my safety.

After my post, I received messages from people sharing that they had been sexuallly assaulted by Masami. I then shared these messages with BUFU and Esthur of YJC. Instead of honoring those survivors, that information was covered up so that Masami could continue hosting parties at Nobar of which Esthur had a financial relationship. The business between Nobar, Esthur, and their friends in YJC and BUFU was maintained and as a result enabled Masami's behavior.

I'm tired of this class-privileged group using the issues that don't directly affect them like police and prisons to gain a reputation and clout while disposing of those who actually live/lived through and are directly affected by those issues. I'm tired of terfs who interpreted the situation as if I were a man regardless of my actual gender identity.

My well-being is something of a gift from myself and others. Because of support from the pod, therapy, friends, and my spiritual values.

While it would be nice to have people see things from my perspective, I know it is not possible all the time and that's okay.

People chose people with more clout. I don't have clout to offer.

## What happened since your callout?

In part the situation only escalated and became worse because of people's inability to take it seriously in the first place. Ann would have never moved her business here if people close to Vacancy Project would have supported those initial claims. But the absence of pressure enabled her. The situation would have been resolved before but only got worse because of people's fear of conflict and inability to resolve their proximity to clout and ytness.

You as an individual may not realize the impact of your actions but if someone like myself is saying your speech is creating problems for me and I want that to change so I can have more freedom, that seems like a fair request.
